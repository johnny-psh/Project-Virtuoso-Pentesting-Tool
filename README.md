## Synopsis
Project Virtuoso is coded in bash, designed to run on Kali Linux using existing tools on Kali Linux. This tool will follow the pentester from the reconnaissance phase to clear track phase. Each phase consist of a few tools that is built into Kali Linux for quicker access. 

## Motivation
I started this project because of school's project, creating a penetration testing lab. One component require us to code a bash script to automate the process of pentesting. Personally, I love to attend "Capture the flag" competition and I usually find myself wasting time looking for tools. With this project, I hope that I am able to shorten the time it takes to "capture the flag"
